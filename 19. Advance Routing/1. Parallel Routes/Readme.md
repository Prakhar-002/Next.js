**Parallel Routing** in Next.js allows you to **render multiple routes in parallel** inside the same layout.  
Each route can **independently fetch data and render its own UI**, without blocking the others.

It's useful when you want:
- Multiple independent UI sections (e.g., chat + inbox) 🧩
- Tabs, modals, dashboards that load separately 🪟
- Better UX with non-blocking sections ⚡

</br>

## 🛠️ How It Works

Next.js lets you define **named slots** using folders with the `@` symbol:

      🗂️ `app/`  
      | 
      ├── `🗂️@chat/`  
      |    |
      │    └── `⚛️page.tsx` → renders chat panel  
      |    
      ├── `🗂️@inbox/`  
      |    |
      │    └── `⚛️page.tsx` → renders inbox panel  
      |    
      └── `⚛️layout.tsx` → includes both slots
